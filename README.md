# python-testing-grounds

Welcome to my playground ~

The projects/code in this repo are to be used with my permission of course, however most projects are personal and probably very nooby in terms of code or useless to most. 
This repo is solely open to track the progress of my coding journey.

Feedback is always welcome, you are free to download/submit bug tests, it'll help improve my code and teach me a few things!
